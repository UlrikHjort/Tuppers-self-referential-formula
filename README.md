Tupper's self-referential formula: 1/2 < floor(mod(floor(y/17)*2^(-17*floor(x)-mod(floor(y), 17)),2)) 
 that can visually represents itself when graphed at a specific k encoded bitmap image located in the (x, y) plane. 
The formula's general-purpose method of decoding a bitmap stored in the constant k
makes it possible to draw any other 106x17 sized bitmap image.

Image examples for k values that give the formula itself, Pacman and Eulers formula.
